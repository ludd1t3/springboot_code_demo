# springboot_code_demo
Springboot interview coding exercise

1. Implement a REST Endpoint that retrieves the list of invoices.
2. Implement a REST Endpoint that retrieves an invoice by id.
3. Demonstrate how to paginate the results.
4. Demonstrate with Spring Security how to apply an ACL security filter to the endpoint that retrieves an invoice by id.

We have 20 minutes for this coding exercise. 
We are interested in seeing how you approach the problem and how you structure your code. We are not expecting a fully working solution, but we would like to see how you would approach the problem.

Please use com.example.demo.InvoiceService.java to generate the list of invoices, and retrieve an invoice by id.
